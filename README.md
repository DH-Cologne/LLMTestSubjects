# LLMTestSubjects
Series of experiments to evaluate whether LLMs can be used to replace participants in linguistic experiments.

## Pronomina
Based on the two papers ([Patterson and Schumacher 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/interpretation-preferences-in-contexts-with-three-antecedents-examining-the-role-of-prominence-in-german-pronouns/E8F581347980C5A0A3D3D938B8F8F30A) and [Patterson et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.672927/full)), we analyse whether LLMs 
* could make similar judgements about the acceptability of pronoun references as human subjects
* prefer the same R-expressions for pronouns as human subjects.
* can be used reliably in anaphora resolution.
